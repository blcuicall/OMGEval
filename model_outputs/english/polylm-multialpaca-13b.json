In 270 BC, the Greek astronomer, Aristarchus of Samos, was the first to suggest that the Earth was not flat, but instead, a sphere. This idea was further developed by the Roman astronomer, Ptolemy, in the 2nd century AD. Ptolemy's work was based on the observation of the night sky and the movement of celestial objects. This observation was further supported by the work of the Arab scientist, Al-biruni, who wrote a book in the 11th century AD titled \"The World in Balance\". This book described the Earth as a sphere and provided evidence from the movement of celestial objects. This idea was further developed by the European scientists of the Renaissance, who used the telescope to observe the night sky and the movement of celestial objects. This observation was the final confirmation that the Earth was a sphere.\n",

Water safety engineering is the application of engineering principles and techniques to ensure the safety of people in and around water. It involves the analysis of water-related risks, the design of water-related structures and systems, and the evaluation of their performance. Water safety engineering projects range from small-scale recreational structures to large-scale water infrastructure projects. \n The most common water safety engineering projects include the design of swimming pools, water slides, water parks, and water-related recreational structures. These projects require careful consideration of the hydrodynamics of the water, the stability of the structure, and the safety of the users. Water safety engineers must also consider the effects of waves, currents, and wind on the structure and its users. Additionally, water safety engineers must consider the environmental conditions, such as water temperature, salinity, and pH, as they affect the safety of users. \n Water safety engineering projects also include the design of water-related systems, such as water supply systems, wastewater systems, and water distribution systems. These systems must be designed to ensure the safety of the users, while minimizing costs and maximizing efficiency. Water safety engineers must consider the physical and chemical properties of the water, as well as the operational and maintenance requirements of the system. \n Water safety engineering projects also include the design of water-related structures that are not primarily recreational in nature. These structures include water supply and storage facilities, flood control structures, and water conservation structures. Water safety engineers must consider the hydrodynamics of the water, the stability of the structure, and the safety of the users when designing these structures. \n Water safety engineering projects also include the design of water-related systems that are used for industrial purposes.

Mathematics has itself been described as an art motivated by beauty. Mathematics can be discerned in arts such as music, dance, painting, architecture, sculpture, and textiles. This article focuses, however, on mathematics in the visual arts.\nMathematics and art have a long historical relationship. Artists have used mathematics since the 4th century BC when the Greek sculptor Polykleitos wrote his Canon, prescribing proportions conjectured to have been based on the ratio 1:√2 for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the golden ratio in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian Renaissance, Luca Pacioli wrote the influential treatise De divina proportione (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by Leonardo da Vinci, on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, Piero della Francesca, developed Euclid's ideas on perspective in treatises such as De Prospectiva Pingendi, and in his paintings. The engraver Albrecht Dürer made many references to mathematics in his work Melencolia I. In modern times, the graphic artist M. C. Escher made intensive use of tessellation and hyperbolic geometry, with the help of the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter, while the De Stijl movement led by Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery, weaving, Turkish and other carpet-making, as well as kilim. In Islamic art, symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian girih and Moroccan zellige tilework, Mughal jali pierced stone screens, and widespread muqarnas vaulting.",

In this paper, we focus on the FSL problem of dialogue understanding, which contains two closely related tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Dialogue understanding has been proven to benefit a lot from jointly learning the two sub-tasks. However, such joint learning becomes challenging in the few-shot scenarios: on the one hand, the sparsity of samples greatly magnifies the difficulty of modeling the connection between the two tasks; on the other hand, how to jointly learn multiple tasks in the few-shot setting is still less investigated. In response to this, we introduce FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, we find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing. Besides, we introduce a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains. In the experiments, the proposed method brings significant improvements on two datasets and achieve new state-of-the-art performance.",

        "output": " Social media platforms have had a significant impact on the way people consume and share news. On platforms like Facebook and Twitter, users are exposed to a wide range of content, including news stories, opinion pieces, and user-generated content. This can lead to a greater diversity of perspectives, but it can also lead to the spread of misinformation. Platforms can help by implementing measures such as fact-checking, flagging content that is false, and removing it from their platform. However, it is important to note that these measures are only effective if users are aware of the content and are willing to check the facts before sharing. Additionally, it is important to consider the potential implications of these measures, such as limiting free speech and limiting access to information.\n",

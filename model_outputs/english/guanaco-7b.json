The stick was used to measure the Earth's girth from two different points, one in the Nile and one in the Mediterranean, and Eratosthenes was able to calculate the Earth's girth to within 10%.\n\nIn the 15th century, the explorers Christopher Columbus and Ferdinand Magellan sailed around the world and provided evidence that the Earth was spherical. However, the idea that the Earth was a sphere was still met with some resistance, as many people believed that the Earth was flat. This resistance persisted until the 19th century, when the evidence that the Earth was a sphere was overwhelming.",

The equation has 7 parameters: the formation rate of stars, the fractions of stars that have planets, the fractions of planets that can support life, the fractions of planets that can develop life, the fractions of planets with intelligent life, the fractions of intelligent life that are technological, and the fractions of technological civilizations that we can detect. \n\nThe formation rate of stars is difficult to measure, so it is usually estimated at 1 star per year per galaxy. The fractions of stars that have planets are also difficult to measure, but astronomers generally use a value of 0.5. The fractions of planets that can support life are also difficult to measure, but astronomers generally use a value of 0.01. The fractions of planets that can develop life are also difficult to measure, but astronomers generally use a value of 0.01. The fractions of planets with intelligent life are also difficult to measure, but astronomers generally use a value of 0.001. The fractions of intelligent life that are technological are also difficult to measure, but astronomers generally use a value of 0.001. The fractions of technological civilizations that we can detect are also difficult to measure, but astronomers generally use a value of 0.01. \n\nUsing these values, the result of the Drake Equation is 10^8, which is the estimated number of intelligent civilizations in our galaxy. The error margins for each of the parameters are difficult to measure, but astronomers generally use a value of 0.2 for each parameter. This means that the result of the Drake Equation could range from 10^8 to 10^10 intelligent civilizations in our galaxy.",

This method involves the targeting of specific genes with Crispr and the Cas9 protein to edit or delete them. This can be used to change physical features such as skin color, hair color, and eye color. \n\nSamples of Crispr-Cas9 reprograming physical features include changing the skin color of a white person to a brown person by targeting the genes that code for the production of melanin.

We're a week into our trip and this is the quietest I've ever been when hanging out with another person as he rebuffs all my attempts at conversation. He wears his airpods in the car and around the accommodation - not that I've kept trying to talk to him. Honestly, he is bringing some seriously bad vibes to everything and it's ruining my trip.\nWe don't have anything booked in yet for the South Island, so I'm planning to ditch him in Wellington at the ferry. Probably book my own car in Picton and just relax alone for the rest of the trip. (Just thinking about it is such sharp relief that it makes me feel emotional. I'll pay whatever price I have to just to get away from him.)\nObviously telling him he is ruining my trip with his negative energy isn't the best way to approach this.\nAny advice for the best approach so we can split amicably?

Yes it's an innovative story, told via a strong script, engaging characters and intense cinematography. But is it really worthy of such high praise? Personally, I find it starts to fall apart halfway through and actually becomes quite tedious towards the end. Everything just becomes a little bit childish and contrived as the story loses touch with its base elements and the rage against the machine vibe takes over. I have huge respect for the way this film was made but, much like The Matrix, I feel like people attach way more importance to this movie than it deserves.\nReview 2: The film tells the story of men who cannot adapt to the social order in today's world, under the leadership of Tyler Durden, to discover their natural instinct, masculinity, and to escape from their unhappy lives.\nReview 3: Despite a good theme, great acting and important messages that this movie convey in an unorthodox way, I think it fails to connect the audience with the storyline and leaves him in a world of confusion. Although, majority of reviews find this movie entertaining and interesting, yet I would choose to be a minority that believes that this movie is extremely overrated.\nReview 4: Is creating chaos, explosions and membership in a militant sect the way to get rid of material shackles ?!

Mathematics has itself been described as an art motivated by beauty. Mathematics can be discerned in arts such as music, dance, painting, architecture, sculpture, and textiles. This article focuses, however, on mathematics in the visual arts.\nMathematics and art have a long historical relationship. Artists have used mathematics since the 4th century BC when the Greek sculptor Polykleitos wrote his Canon, prescribing proportions conjectured to have been based on the ratio 1:√2 for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the golden ratio in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian Renaissance, Luca Pacioli wrote the influential treatise De divina proportione (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by Leonardo da Vinci, on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, Piero della Francesca, developed Euclid's ideas on perspective in treatises such as De Prospectiva Pingendi, and in his paintings. The engraver Albrecht Dürer made many references to mathematics in his work Melencolia I. In modern times, the graphic artist M. C. Escher made intensive use of tessellation and hyperbolic geometry, with the help of the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter, while the De Stijl movement led by Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery, weaving, Turkish and other carpet-making, as well as kilim. In Islamic art, symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian girih and Moroccan zellige tilework, Mughal jali pierced stone screens, and widespread muqarnas vaulting.",

The output of this task is a set of structure rules that can be used to determine the syntactic structure of a sentence. This task is challenging because it requires the model to recognize the structure of a sentence even when it is long and has complex syntactic relationships.

In this paper, we focus on the FSL problem of dialogue understanding, which contains two closely related tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Dialogue understanding has been proven to benefit a lot from jointly learning the two sub-tasks. However, such joint learning becomes challenging in the few-shot scenarios: on the one hand, the sparsity of samples greatly magnifies the difficulty of modeling the connection between the two tasks; on the other hand, how to jointly learn multiple tasks in the few-shot setting is still less investigated. In response to this, we introduce FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, we find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing. Besides, we introduce a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains. In the experiments, the proposed method brings significant improvements on two datasets and achieve new state-of-the-art performance.",
